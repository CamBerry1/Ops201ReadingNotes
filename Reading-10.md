## Why this topic relates to the module
We've been using VM's for Windows and Linux, using snapshots as our de facto method of backing up. Having a tool like Veeam at our fingertips give us more power with backups.

## Summary
Saving a snapshot of in VirtualBox has served well so far. It appears the Veeam software goes one step further and makes the backup available to be moved, copied, or loaded into other VM software. It also boasts a smaller file size for VM backups. All in all, it looks like a tool for faster, smarter, and more efficient backups.

Interested to know what kind of power this has. Looking forward to diving into it (I assume that's why we're being linked to the user guide as well)
