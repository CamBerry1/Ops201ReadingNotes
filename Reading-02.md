## Why this topic relates to the module
We will be using GitHub and VS Code extensively to collaborate on projects. Learning how to utilize the software extensively is the first step.

## Summary
*GitHub<br>Learned how to create a main branch and separate additional branches so as not to corrupt the main before getting feedback. After changes are made, you can then compare the new with the old, and modify the main source with the additions.<br>
*VS Code<br>Everything is such brand new vocabulary. It's a little overwhelming and I don't know where to start. I do get the impression that VS Code is an extremely powerful tool once you know how to use it.
