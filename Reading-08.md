## Why this topic relates to the module
The Windows Registry can be a very powerful tool, for good or for evil. It's beneficial to know how it works and how to manipulate it safely.

## Summary
The Registry Editor doesn't have to be a scary tool, if you know what you're doing. It can allow someone to change settings that aren't readily available to the average PC user. The section on 'registry hacks' is pretty interesting. Even just as examples, it demonstrates the power of knowing how to access back-end settings. I wouldn't even have thought of adding an application to a right-click menu, and knowing that that is possible opens a whole new world of customization.<br>
When it comes to the kinds of things we're studying, we can use the registry to, for example, limit a users access to certain parts of the machine. I can also imagine that knowing how the registry works can help to keep an eye out for attacks. It seems very susceptible to malicious intent.

## Things I want to know more about
I'm going to do my best to put time aside to run through some of those 'registry hacks' in a windows VM, just to get some hands on experience.
