## Why this topic relates to the module
Organizations need organization. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are in place to ensure consistency. As far as the IT side goes, learning how to write an SOP for a particular task will ensure that the task is done correctly each time.

## Summary
Standard Operating Procedures enforce the polocies of an organization. Polocies steer to achieve mission, vision, and goals, and SOPs are in place to make those polocies actionable.<br>

SOPs must be: readable, consumable, understandable, actionable, and measurable.<br>

Starting with a flowchart is much like writing a first draft. To make it usable, try to condense the chart into 5-7 steps. We can use that flowchart to create a written document, detailing each step.<br>

The author recommends 5 guiding principles<br>* Keep it simple<br>* SOPs must be portable (ie even when a tool is changed, the "what, when, and why" generally will not)<br>* Flowcharts and Diagrams tell a story<br>* Consistency Counts (format or tamplate)<br>* It's about the audience
