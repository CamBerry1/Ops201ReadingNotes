## Why this topic relates to the module
We're no longer the people who seek out help when we have an issue. As we learn the technical skills, we will be the ones with the knowledge to fix the problem. Diagnosis is the first step.

## Summary
Troubleshooting is a very step-by-step process. Diagnosis, brainstorming possible fixes, testing those fixes, and then implementing the fix (provided one of your theories works). Disagnosing the problem requires a great deal of critical thinking. There could be any number of reasons why x is happening. Gathering as much information from the system, and the customer, helps a great deal in focusing on where the problem may lie. Once you've isolated the issue, it's time to use our know-how to come up with ways to fix it. After finding one that works, it's time to implement it. In a huge system this may not be possible at just any given time. For examplem, maybe the peice that needs to be worked on can only be shut down at night. It's up to us to find the most efficient way to get the system up and running.

## Things I want to know more about
Not necessarily know more about, but troubleshooting reminds me of the scientific method.
